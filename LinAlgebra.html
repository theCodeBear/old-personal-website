    <header> Linear Algebra Hill Cipher in C++ </header>
    <p> In the fall of 2012 I had to do a group project in my Linear Algebra course on a self-assigned topic.
        We chose Cryptography and I wrote the following program in C++ for our project. It uses the
        cryptological method known as the Hill Cipher.
        <br>
        You type in a plain text message and the program puts the characters into a three-row matrix, the
        characters going down and then to the right. The ASCII characters are then converted into their
        numerical ASCII values, which forms a new matrix of integers. A 3x3 encoding matrix is then randomly
        generated. The encoding matrix and the converted number matrix are multiplied together to create a
        ciphertext matrix (this matrix of numbers is what would be sent to the receiver, and the receiver
        would need to know what the encoding matrix was in order to decrypt the ciphertext). The program
        then computes the inverse of the encoding matrix that was randomly generated earlier. This inverse
        matrix is the decoder matrix (the deciphering key). The decoder matrix and the cipher matrix are
        then multiplied together to computer a matrix identical to the original number matrix. Then
        converting the number matrix back to its ASCII characters and the original message is then output.
