            <p> My first job in the Computer Science field was my Fall Semester Co-op in 2013 at
                AIR Worldwide in Boston, MA. I worked on the Help Desk in the IT Department. My
                main duties were solving technical issues for fellow employees, getting machines
                ready each week for new hires, and leading the IT orientation for new hires each week.
