    <p> Sigma Shooter is a console window Shoot 'em Up game I made between late March and mid-April of 2013
        as my final project for the Assembly Language course I did as an independent study at Wentorth Institute of Technology. The game is programmed using the MASM Microsoft Assembler in Visual Studio
        2010. The source code is just over 2500 lines.
        <br><br>
        The player controls a ship represented by the Sigma ASCII symbol. The player moves with the arrow
        keys on the keyboard. The player can shoot lasers and lay bombs. There are enemies that show up
        in waves and don't have any weapons but do track the player and attempt to dodge lasers and bombs.
        There are upgrade items that show up occasionally, one upgrade for bombs and one for lasers.
        Asteroids also fly through the play area, destroying the enemies or the player if they are hit by
        the asteroid. Asteroids move with various speeds and trajectories across the gameplay screen. There
        are three gameplay modes, several levels, three color themes, and three difficulty levels to choose
        from. There is a gametime clock displayed on screen and a point score.
