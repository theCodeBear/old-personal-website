    <p> I created this Python game demo in the Fall of 2013, just after learning Python, in order to get to
        know the Pygame library. It is a very simple 2D shooting platformer consisting of one stage in which
        the player can move and jump around while firing lasers up, down, left, or right. Enemies appear every few seconds and fly after the player. There is a little bit of AI built in to help get the enemies around platforms in some cases. Video and source code included below.
