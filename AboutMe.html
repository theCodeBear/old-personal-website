        <p> I am 31 years old and have recently nearly completed an undergraduate degree in Computer
            Science. I am currently teaching myself web development and a bit of Mobile development here
            and there. I'm an aspiring Software Developer!
        </p>

        <p> I went back to school two years ago to study Computer Science because it gives me the
            oppurtunity to create things - hopefully one day great things that help or entertain
            people. The most inspiring and rewarding thing in life is the creation of something
            genuine and powerful. I love traveling, adventure, and the solace of the inconvenient.
